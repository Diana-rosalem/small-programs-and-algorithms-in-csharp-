# Small programs and algorithms in C#

Programs and agorithms developed while learning the C# programming language



## Games
**==numRandom** :game_die:==

A game created in C#, whose objective is to guess a secret number, but the player has limited attempts. 

**==Battleship**:anchor: == 

BattleShip is an adaptation of the classic game, which involves guessing and strategy. It is played on 9x9 grids ruled by a fleet of ships, hidden. The player's objective is to find and sink the opponent's ships until the entire fleet is eliminated.

To play, just type the location you want to shoot (row x column).

- Only numbers from 0 to 9 are valid.
- The fleet consists of: 1 of Patrol boat(length 2),2 of Destroyer (length 3),1 Battleship(length 4),1 Carrier(length 5)
- The player has only 40 moves to defeat the entire fleet.



**==Rock Paper Scissors**‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è ==

The classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: At the same time, player and bot play one of three symbols: a rock, paper or scissors. A rock hits the scissors, scissors hit the paper cutting it, and paper hits the rock covering it. 

obs: Game based on Object-Oriented Programming

**I hope you have fun playing**

## Data structures


**==simple_sorting** :card_file_box:==

Program with data sorting types:

- Bubblesort:

Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that can be applied to Arrays and dynamic Lists. If the goal is to sort the values in descending order, then the current position is compared with the next position and if the current position is greater than the later position, the values in that position are swapped. Otherwise, no swapping is performed, just moving on to the next pair of comparisons.

- Selection sort:

Selection sort , is a sorting algorithm that tries to pass always the smallest value of the vector to the first position (or the largest depending on the order required), then the second smallest value to the second position, and so it is done successively with the (n 1) remaining elements, until the last two elements.

- Insertion sort:

Insertion sort , is a simple and efficient algorithm when applied to a small number of slightly disordered elements.
In general terms, it runs through a vector of elements elements from left to right and as it proceeds the leftmost elements in order. 
The insertion algorithm works in much the same way way many people sort cards in a card game like poker. in a deck game like poker.

== **Lists**  ‚õì==

Program with  list types:

- LinkedList

A LinkedList is a linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointers. Or in other words, LinkedList consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list, being the pointer of the last null element. It is a dynamic collection which grows, according to the need of your program. It also provides fast inserting and removing elements.

- Circular list

-The last element is next to the first element in the list, forming a cycle;

-The list can be represented by a pointer to any initial list element;

- Doubly linked list

-It is a doubly linked list, therefore, each node points forward to the Next node and backward to the Previous node.

-Given a pointer to the last element in the list, you can scroll through the list in reverse order;

== **Stack**  üìö==

A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack.

Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

- Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.
- isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.
- Clear: destroys the stack, freeing all memory used by the structure.


Examples of the use of a stack in a system include navigation between web pages, even the undo/redo mechanism of text editors, and also checking the opening and closing of command blocks.
