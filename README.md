# Small programs and algorithms in C#

Programs and agorithms developed while learning the C# programming language



## Games
**==numRandom** :game_die:==

A game created in C#, whose objective is to guess a secret number, but the player has limited attempts. 

**==Battleship**:anchor: == 

BattleShip is an adaptation of the classic game, which involves guessing and strategy. It is played on 9x9 grids ruled by a fleet of ships, hidden. The player's objective is to find and sink the opponent's ships until the entire fleet is eliminated.

To play, just type the location you want to shoot (row x column).

- Only numbers from 0 to 9 are valid.
- The fleet consists of: 1 of Patrol boat(length 2),2 of Destroyer (length 3),1 Battleship(length 4),1 Carrier(length 5)
- The player has only 40 moves to defeat the entire fleet.

I hope you have fun playing

## Data structures


**==simple_sorting** :card_file_box:==

Program with data sorting types:

-Bubblesort:

Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that can be applied to Arrays and dynamic Lists. If the goal is to sort the values in descending order, then the current position is compared with the next position and if the current position is greater than the later position, the values in that position are swapped. Otherwise, no swapping is performed, just moving on to the next pair of comparisons.

-Selection sort:

Selection sort , is a sorting algorithm that tries to pass always the smallest value of the vector to the first position (or the largest depending on the order required), then the second smallest value to the second position, and so it is done successively with the (n 1) remaining elements, until the last two elements.

-Insertion sort:

Insertion sort , is a simple and efficient algorithm when applied to a small number of slightly disordered elements.
In general terms, it runs through a vector of elements elements from left to right and as it proceeds the leftmost elements in order. 
The insertion algorithm works in much the same way way many people sort cards in a card game like poker. in a deck game like poker.

**==grade** :mortar_board:==

Program that allows the teacher to track grades in a single course. It includes methods that calculate the average grade, the highest grade,the lowest grade, number of approved students and  failed students.
