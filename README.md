# Small programs and algorithms in C#

Programs and agorithms developed while learning the C# programming language



## Programs
**==numRandom** :game_die:==

A game created in C#, whose objective is to guess a secret number, but the player has limited attempts. 

**==grade** :mortar_board:==

Program that allows the teacher to track grades in a single course. It includes methods that calculate the average grade, the highest grade,the lowest grade, number of approved students and  failed students.

**==simple_sorting** :card_file_box:==

Program with data sorting types:

-Bubblesort:

Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that can be applied to Arrays and dynamic Lists. If the goal is to sort the values in descending order, then the current position is compared with the next position and if the current position is greater than the later position, the values in that position are swapped. Otherwise, no swapping is performed, just moving on to the next pair of comparisons.
